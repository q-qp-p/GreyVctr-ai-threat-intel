# AI Shield Intelligence

A specialized threat intelligence system for AI/ML security, providing proactive defense against emerging AI-specific attacks through automated monitoring, analysis, and alerting.

## Overview

AI Shield Intelligence systematically identifies, analyzes, and distributes intelligence about emerging threats to AI systems before they impact production services. The system monitors academic papers, security research, GitHub repositories, CVE databases, and community discussions from configurable sources including arXiv, security blogs, Reddit, Hacker News, and more.

**Status**: Architecture design complete, implementation not yet started. Contributions welcome!

## Key Capabilities

### Threat Collection
- Automated monitoring of academic papers (arXiv, conferences)
- GitHub repository and PoC tracking
- Security blog and advisory aggregation
- RSS/API-based collection with hot-reload configuration

### Analysis & Enrichment
- NLP-based threat classification (adversarial, poisoning, extraction, etc.)
- Entity extraction (CVEs, frameworks, techniques, models)
- MITRE ATLAS tactic and technique mapping
- Severity scoring (1-10 scale)
- Optional LLM analysis for summaries and mitigations

### Distribution
- Real-time alerts for high-severity threats
- Weekly threat intelligence briefings
- REST API for programmatic access
- SIEM/SOAR integration support
- Customizable alert thresholds and filters

## Threat Coverage

AI Shield Intelligence covers all categories of AI security threats:

- **Adversarial Attacks**: Evasion, poisoning, backdoors
- **Model Extraction**: Model stealing and parameter theft
- **Privacy Attacks**: Membership inference, model inversion
- **Prompt Attacks**: Injection, jailbreaking for LLMs
- **Data Poisoning**: Training data manipulation
- **Supply Chain**: Attacks on AI components and dependencies

## Getting Started

Choose your deployment profile and follow the respective guide:

### Minimal Local Deployment (Ready Now)

For early pilots, development, or smaller teams:

```bash
cd src/minimal-local
# Follow the detailed guide in src/minimal-local/README.md
```

**Full Instructions**: [src/minimal-local/README.md](src/minimal-local/README.md)

**Quick Summary**:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.minimal` and set passwords
2. Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.minimal.yml --env-file .env.minimal up -d`
3. Initialize database and create admin user
4. Pull LLM model: `ollama pull qwen2.5:7b`
5. Access API at http://localhost:8000

### AWS Deployment (Planned)
